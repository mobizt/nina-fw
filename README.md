# Arduino NINA-W102 firmware build 21060 based on original firmware v1.4.5

This is the fork of Arduino NINA-W102 firmware.

The purpose of this fork is to add the TCP upgradable feature to the original firmware.

This custom built firmware was used with [ESP Mail Client library](https://github.com/mobizt/ESP-Mail-Client).

Any issue related to the APIs provided by the original firmware should visit https://github.com/arduino/nina-fw



This firmware uses [Espressif's IDF](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf)

## Building

1. [Download the ESP32 toolchain](http://esp-idf.readthedocs.io/en/v3.3.1/get-started/index.html#setup-toolchain)
1. Extract it and add it to your `PATH`: `export PATH=$PATH:<path/to/toolchain>/bin`
1. Clone **v3.3.1** of the IDF: `git clone --branch v3.3.1 --recursive https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf.git`
1. Set the `IDF_PATH` environment variable: `export IDF_PATH=<path/to/idf>`
1. Run `make` to build the firmware (in the directory of this read me)
1. Load the `Tools -> SerialNINAPassthrough` example sketch on to the board
1. Use `esptool` to flash the compiled firmware

## Notes
If updating **Arduino UNO WiFi Rev. 2** NINA firmware via [SerialNINAPassthrough](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/WiFiNINA/blob/master/examples/Tools/SerialNINAPassthrough/SerialNINAPassthrough.ino) sketch then the `esptool` invocation needs to be changed slightly:
```diff
-  --baud 115200 --before default_reset
+  --baud 115200 --before no_reset
```
